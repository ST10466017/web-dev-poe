BrightFutures Non-Profit Organisation 

Website overview 

Based in Cape Town, South Africa, BrightFutures is a fictional non-profit organization dedicated to reducing hunger and helping impoverished children with their education. Many households in South Africa are unable to provide daily meals due to the country's persistently high rates of unemployment and food insecurity (Food Forward SA, 2024). By providing mentorship programs, after-school tutoring, and community food programs, BrightFutures seeks to lessen this load. The organization's goal is to provide kids with the information and sustenance they need to create a better future. Its objective is a South Africa where no kid goes to bed hungry and every young person has the opportunity to achieve
